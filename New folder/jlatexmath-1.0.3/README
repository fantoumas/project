To build the jlatexmath library just type ant...
The default task is "buildJar", the others are:
  - source;
  - plugin;
  - embedded;
  - src-all;
  - plugin-src;
  - clean;
  - minimal (for GeoGebra or web applications), dist/jlatexmath-minimal.zip will be created

For the moment, the doc is very poor ... It will come in the future ...
But some examples are provided to show how to use easily the library.

Have fun and if you meet any problem, don't hesitate to write at :
