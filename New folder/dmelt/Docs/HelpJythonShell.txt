 1) Use ! in front of any external program.
             Examples: !latex <file> - will execute latex
                     : !make         - will execute make file
                     : !gv           - will start gv


 2) Typing the file with the extension .py will automatically
    execute it


 3) Command history (Key: Up and Down);
    Style management on text (Popup menu on the console);
    Script loader (Popup menu on the console);
    Java completion (Key: Ctrl + Space);
    Python completion (Key: Ctrl + Space) 


 4) It  uses the following aliases: 
          [CLASSPATH]   - java class path
          [FILE_SHORT]  - returns the file name without the extension
          [FILE_SHORT_NODIR]  - returns the file name without the extension & path
          [FILE]              - returns the full name of the file including the path
          [FILE_NODIR]        - returns the full name of the file excluding the path
          [DIR_FILE]    - returns  file directory
          [DIR_SYS]     - returns system directory


 
 Example: print [FILE] and you should see the name of the currently opened file
 Note: Such substitutions can be used in macros. For example, if  your macro
 contains [FILE], it will be automatically replaced by the current file name
 There is a special command: run. 
 This is just a shortcut to the command source([FILE]),
 i.e. the currently edited file will be evaluated.

5) One can access all the information about the currently opened 
    document, as well as the jeHEP GUI frame, by  using the variables:

    -  textArea         - the text area (like for jEdit) 
    -  view             - the main GUI window. Can be used as a replacement for 
                          the textArea 
    -  SystemDir        - the system directory;
    -  UserMacrosDir    - the user directory with macros 
    -  DocName          - the name of the last opened document  directory 
    -  DocMasterName    - the name of the last opened document without the extension. 
    -  DocDir           - the directory of the last opened document  directory 
    -  DocStyle         - the style of the last opened document  directory 
    -  DicDir           - the directory with dictionaries 
 
   Check this by typing "dir()" command. 
   Check all the methods as: "view." +  Ctrl + Space



6)  You can view all avalable methods by typing "obrowser";
    This will open object browser window with all objects.
    If you want to add some object, do this: obrowser.add(your object);

     Example:
        >>  obrowser
        >> a=JLabel("OK");
        >> obrowser.add(a);


7) The user can put macros to the macros/user directory. There
   are already several macros in the system directory. For example,
   one can replace a string with another string in the current text just
   by calling replace(String1, String2); In fact, the macros should be
   rather similar to jEdirt macros, as long as you are using the textArea class.
